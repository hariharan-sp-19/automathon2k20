Hello everyone,
    The idea of the bot is to fetch the NPS score of cloudcherry platform for a specific type of questionaire set which is essential to gauge the customer experiance of a product. Here i have took the purchase experiance score of android platform specifically and stored it in the Azure virtual machine.
